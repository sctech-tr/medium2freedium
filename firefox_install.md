# firefox

**important notice: if you want to sideload the xpi, you should first go to `about:config` and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to false. otherwise, it will say it is broken.**

i submitted it to mozilla add-ons:  
https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/medium-to-freedium/

or you can download the .xpi file directly.
